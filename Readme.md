# Code challenge
This project is a test automation challenge for a feature of [this](https://thinkific.com/) web application. It uses Cypress and Chrome.

## Prerequisites
You must have Git, Cypress and Chrome installed on your system.

## Getting started
Clone the repository, open the file /cypress/integration/new_instructor_spec.js and edit the email and password of the Tenant you want to run your tests with.

## Running the tests
Run Cypress from your cloned repository folder and click on the new_instructor_spec.js file.

### Scenario
The test on this project follows the Page Object Model to separate web element interactions from the step definitions, what increases readability, maintainability and scalability. It also follows the Domain Specific Language (DSL) approach to abstract the actions performed by the user, making the test describe the closest possible what a real user would experience.
